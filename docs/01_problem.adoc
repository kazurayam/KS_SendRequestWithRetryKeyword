== Problem to solve

=== Application Under Test

This project bundles a HTTP Server. When the server is up, a URL becomes available:

- http://localhost:3000/naughty


I will describe how to start the server up later.

This URL has following characteristics.

(1) It returns an HTTP response with STATUS=200 and a JSON body:
```
{
  "title": "JavaScript本格入門",
  "price": 3200,
  "publisher": "技術評論社"
}
```

(2) It occasionaly returns an HTTP response with STATUS=500 and a HTML body:
```
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>500 Internal Server Error
    </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>500 Internal Server Error
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

(3) It returns an Error at random. The probability is approximately 33%. 1 error per 3 requests. You can read the server source in JavaScript at link:https://github.com/kazurayam/KS_modify_SendRequestKeyword_with_retry/blob/master/webserver/app.ts[] ,Line#64 :
