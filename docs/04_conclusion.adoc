== Conclusion

The `com.kazurayam.ks.KzSendRequestKeyword` class and the `com.kazurayam.ks.WSBuiltInKeywordsModifier` class enable you to modify the built-in `WS.sendRequest(RequestObject,FailureHandling)` keyword on the fly. The modified `WS.sendRequest` method will be robust against the occational errors responded by the AUT. The volume of code changes required for the existing Test Cases could be small and manageable.
