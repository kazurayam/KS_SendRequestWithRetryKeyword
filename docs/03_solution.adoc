== Solution

It is ideal if the built-in `WS.sendRequest` keyword in Katalon Studio is changed to be robust against server errors. But I can't wait for their product development. Here I would show you my custom Groovy codes that give you the second best solution.

=== Custom Groovy classes

I have developed 2 Groovy classes.

==== com.kazurayam.ks.KzSendRequestKeyword

- link:https://github.com/kazurayam/KS_modify_SendRequestKeyword_with_retry/blob/develop/Keywords/com/kazurayam/ks/KzSendRequestKeyword.groovy[Keywords/com/kazurayam/ks/KzSendRequestKeyword.groovy]

This class implements an alternative to the built-in `WS.sendRequest(RequestObject, FailureHandling)` keyword. This class send an HTTP Reuest and returns the ResponseObject. The difference is that, when the server returned an HTTP respose with STATUS != 200 OK, then the class makes retry silently.

==== com.kazurayam.ks.WSBuiltInKeywordsModifier

- link:https://github.com/kazurayam/KS_modify_SendRequestKeyword_with_retry/blob/develop/Keywords/com/kazurayam/ks/WSBuiltInKeywordsModifier.groovy[Keywords/com/kazurayam/ks/WSBuiltInKeywordsModifier.groovy]

This class modifies the `sendRequest` method of `com.kms.katalon.core.webservice.keyword.WSBuiltInKeywords` class. Once the `modifySendRequest()` methos is called, the `sendRequest` method will be dynamically changed. The `WS.sendRequest()` call will no more uses the built-in class, but the method uses the `com.kazurayam.ks.KzSendRequestKeyword`.

=== Descriptions

==== How the custom `sendRequestWithRetry` method works

I have developed 2 Test Cases to demonstrate how I can use the custom class `com.kazurayam.ks.KzSendRequestWithRetry`.

I ran the latter script which repeats calling the former script for 10 times. The former script gets the naught URL, which of course often responds with error of STATUS=500. But the the `KzSendRequestWithRetry` hide ths server error and silently makes retry. So the later script finished successful.

==== Want to modify the `WS.sendRequest` keyword for retry

Let me imagine that I have 200 Test Case scripts that calls the `WS.sendRequest` keyword. Now, I have developed a custom keyword `WSK.sendRequestWithRetry`. So, I should rewrite my scripts to use `WSK.sendRequestWithRetry` instead of `WS.sendRequest`. Oops, too much works. I don't like to do it. Any other idea that requires far less rewrite works?

Here I introduce the `com.kazurayam.ks.WSBuitlInKeywordsModifier`. I have made 2 Test Case scripts to demostrate how to use it.

- link:https://github.com/kazurayam/KS_modify_SendRequestKeyword_with_retry/blob/develop/Scripts/my/get%20naughty%20URL%20using%20modified%20keyword/Script1716685136061.groovy[Test Cases/my/get naughty URL using modified keyword]

In this script, I call the `WSBuildInKeywordsModifier` to dynamically replace the implementation of `sendRequest(RequestObject,FailureHandling)` of the `com.kms.katalon.core.webservice.keyword.WSBuiltInKeywords` class. The new implementation will link to the `com.kazurayam.ks.KzSendRequestKeyword` class, instead of the built-in `com.kms.katalon.core.webservice.kehyword.builtin.SendRequestKeyword`.

The most interesting thing in this script is the following 2 lines:

[source,groovy]

include::../Scripts/my/get naughty URL using modified keyword/Script1716685136061.groovy[lines=15..17]
----

Here, the `sendRequest` method of `WSBuiltInKeywords` class is dynamically modified. Then we continu using the built-in `WS.sendRequest` keyword. I do not call `WSK.sendRequestWithRetry` explicitly, but I do call it indirectly.

Again, I made another scpript that calls the former script multiple times.
